### Team Work Contract for Group 26

To establish a healthy work environment where everyone can bring out their best, we have developed the following team work contract. All the team members of group 26 (Bruhat Musunuru, Siqi Zhou, Chun Chieh(Jason) Chang) agree with the terms and conditions as described below. These terms should be followed as close as possible in order to maintain an efficient and healthy work environment.


* **How will work be distributed in a fair and equitable way?**

The workload will be estimated before distributing the tasks and each group member will take a task or file write up which requires roughly the same workload and time to complete for every project submission.

Each group member will also be responsible to review and agree to merge another member’s pull request. Since everyone has different working schedule, we will have a separate meeting where each member will gather and review the pull requests and merge them when they are approved.

* **What are the expected work hours for the project?** 

This project will take approximately 1-2 hours for meeting, and about 2-3 hours per person for writing the proposal, scripts, running and testing the results, and rendering the results. 

* **How often will group meetings occur?** 

The zoom group meetings will occur 1-2 times per week, with daily group chat communications whenever necessary.

* **Will you have meeting agendas and minutes? If so, what will be the system for rotating through these responsibilities?**

Yes, before each meeting, we will have a shared google doc ready for agenda and estimated time for the topics and tasks to be conducted. During the meeting, notes will be taken briefly and synchronously. 

In general, the role of notetaker will be rotated every week for 4 weeks so each group member will get a chance to take these responsibilities.

* **What will be the style of working?**
  * Will you start each day with stand-ups, or submit a summary of your contributions 4 hours before each meeting? or something else?

The discussion and communication will be performed mainly via zoom meeting and through the slack group channel, while the coding/writing parts will be completed individually first, then after pushing and accepting the changes, the results and reports will be brought together on GitHub repository for reviewing and finalizing. Any problems or challenges encountered will be discussed together as a group. The contributions from each member will be summarized when the individual task is finished before the wrap-up meeting.

* **What happens if I cannot complete my assigned task because I do not understand it?**

If someone doesn't understand how to complete an aspect of the project, feel free to reach out to other group member and
that group member can walk the person through the task.

* **What is the quality of work each team member expects from themselves and each other?**

Each team member expects themselves to complete the assigned work in a timely manner, and check to ensure the quality of the work (avoid any grammar mistakes for writings, and avoid any errors for codes). 

Each team member expects each other to complete their own tasks before the proposed deadline, and to be able to review each other’s work before merging into the group repository.

* **Are team members expected to work for the whole week?**

Sunday should be resting day for everyone as it is crucial for one's health both physically and spiritually.

* **And any other similar things that govern your working relationships.** 

Each team member should respect each other, diversity, and/or cultural differences. Toxic and trolling behaviours are strictly prohibited and would be reported to the faculty members if needed.

If any emergency situations come up so that one member cannot finish the assigned work on time, they should communicate to other group members first in a timely manner, and other group members may distribute the task to make sure the group project can still be completed on time.
